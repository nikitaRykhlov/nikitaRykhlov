# Hello ðŸ‘‹

## About
<p class="text-block">I have over 5 years of experience in software development, focusing on building robust and scalable solutions that drive value across various industries. My expertise lies in designing and maintaining high-load distributed systems, where performance, reliability, and fault tolerance are essential under intense workloads. I emphasize creating architectures that are not only scalable and flexible but also easy to support and evolve over time. I always strive to deliver high-quality results that align with both user expectations and business goals.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked in large technology companies known for their rigorous standards, which helped me develop a strategic mindset and the ability to craft long-lasting, efficient solutions. In addition to back-end development, I have hands-on experience in front-end technologies, allowing me to approach projects from a full-stack perspective.

I enjoy sharing knowledge and best practices, which is why I actively maintain and develop a technical blog. It serves as a platform to document insights, explore new technologies, and contribute to the developer community.

I thrive in team environments, adapt quickly to new settings, and am committed to mastering tools and technologies to achieve the best possible outcomes. When entrusted with a task, I take full ownership and ensure timely delivery with high efficiency and quality, regardless of the projectâ€™s scope or audience.</p>
