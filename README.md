# Hello ðŸ‘‹

## About
<p class="text-block">I am a developer with experience in creating complex B2B solutions and microservice architectures, specializing in Golang. I am skilled in designing and developing scalable systems, with a particular focus on code quality and test coverage. In my work, I actively apply the TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology, which ensures high reliability of solutions from the very beginning of development. I also use the DDD (Domain-Driven Design) approach to create flexible and maintainable architectures that align with business goals. I have experience conducting technical interviews, including system design, as well as implementing modern development practices such as containerization (Docker) and working with Kubernetes.</p>

<p class="text-block">In addition to backend development, I have practical experience in frontend development, having worked with technologies like React and Angular. This allows me to effectively collaborate with frontend teams and develop full-stack solutions, from client-side interfaces to server-side logic. I am capable of efficiently solving tasks within a team, quickly adapting to new conditions, and mastering technologies to achieve business objectives.</p>
