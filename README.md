# Hello ðŸ‘‹

## About
<p class="text-block">I have over <b>5 years of experience</b> in software development, specializing in creating complex solutions that benefit not only businesses but also other fields. I have extensive experience in designing and developing high-load distributed systems, where stability, speed, and reliability are critical, even under heavy data and request volumes. I focus on architecting solutions that are scalable, adaptable to growing demands, and easy to maintain in the long term. In all my projects, I prioritize quality and ensure the results meet both user expectations and business needs.

Additionally, I have worked in large technology companies with exceptionally high standards for their products. This has taught me to think strategically, understand diverse requirements, and create solutions that remain effective and relevant over time. Beyond back-end system design, I also have hands-on experience building user-friendly interfaces, allowing me to approach projects holistically â€” from user interaction to technical implementation.

I excel at working in teams, quickly adapt to new environments, and master technologies to achieve desired outcomes. When you assign a task to me, you can rest assured that I will see it through to completion without requiring constant oversight. I guarantee that the work will be delivered on time, with optimal efficiency and the highest quality, no matter who itâ€™s intended for or what goals it serves.</p>
